# -Credit-risk-modelling-ML-development:
We will use machine learning model to predict defaulting behavior of Customers applying for a loan. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of sci-kit learn and understand concepts behind machine learning algorithms. We will be taking the following steps:

1.Data Collection

2.Data Processing

3.Model Training

4.Model testing

5.Model Optimization

6.Model Evaluation

Requirements
Numpy - Array manipulations and computations

Pandas - Creating data frames and exploring Dataset

Scikit-learn - Importing different Models and different evaluation metrics to check model performace
